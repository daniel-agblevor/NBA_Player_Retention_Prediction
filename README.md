# Preparing NBA Dataset for Modelling

This project focuses on preparing a dataset for modelling and analysis related to the NBA. It involves processing raw basketball data to make it suitable for predictive analytics, machine learning, or statistical exploration. The primary objective is to create a clean and enriched dataset that provides actionable insights and supports the development of robust models for NBA-related scenarios.

The notebook included in this repository walks through the key stages of data preparation:

- Loading raw NBA datasets.
- Cleaning and organizing the data to remove inconsistencies.
- Engineering features to enhance the dataset's predictive power.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and relationships within the data.
- Exporting the final prepared dataset for downstream applications.

By the end of this process, users will have a ready-to-use dataset and a comprehensive understanding of the data preparation steps involved in NBA modelling projects.
