# Preparing NBA Dataset for Modelling

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook focused on preparing an NBA dataset for predictive modelling and analysis. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps to ensure the dataset is ready for machine learning or statistical tasks.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load raw NBA data from various sources.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data entries.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to enhance predictive modelling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and summarize data for better understanding.
- **Export Prepared Dataset**: Save the cleaned and processed data for further modelling.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Recommended libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nba-dataset-prep.git
   cd nba-dataset-prep
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `Preparing NBA dataset for Modelling..ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.

## Usage

1. Place your raw NBA dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the notebook to preprocess the data and generate new features.
3. Save the processed dataset for further use in predictive modelling.

## Outputs

- **Cleaned Dataset**: A processed dataset ready for modelling.
- **Visualizations**: Key insights about data trends and relationships.
